After having houseplants as one of my hobbies for a few months, I've noticed there's a huge market gap. There is no application to discover plants. It means that every time you want to adquire a new plant, you have to look for trending plants in pinterest or other websites and then research about how to take care of them.

## What is Chooseyourplant
[Chooseyourplant](https://www.chooseyourplant.com) is a houseplant marketplace to discover and get your next houseplant in a few clicks. How cool would it be to say what the requirements are and what do you want your next house plant to look like? Now it is possible!

In addition, not only it lets you discover plants but:
- Add them to your wishlist
- Buy them through external links.
- Learn its specifications
- Understand what are its needs
- Tips to make your plant grow like hell!
- Know similar plants of the one you loved

##  For who is it

Even though you're new in the indoor plants hobbie or you have some experience, I'm sure you will always discover plants you ove how they look. Because of this, I believe that [Chooseyourplant](https://www.chooseyourplant.com) is for everyone who like plants.
