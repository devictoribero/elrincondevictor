If you're building a blog or a community, or you already have them I guess you're asked to yourself how possibly you can reach more people and get traction. Well, I'm going to explain to you what metrics I read in order to improve Chooseyourplant, the community I'm building, and these metrics can help you.

You can reach more people by 2 different ways. Either you pay ads (I don't like this idea because it's not sustainable if you're not monetizing your site), or we get exposed to people organically by how high your blog or community is ranking on Google or other Search Engines. We'll talk about the second one which is good for long term and gives us information about how well we're doing.

# Why is important to know better your users
As much as you know about your users, is going to help you in order to:
- Optimize SEO keywords
- Optimize the creation of content for the area they live
- Optimize the user interface and user experience for them
- Optimize money in case you run ads

ChooseYourPlant is a worldwide community for houseplant lovers, and as a solo-founder I need to think twice about in what should I invest my time because of my capacity. To understand better the project, the people using it and how to expand the community, I wanted to understand a few things:
- Where are the users from?
- What do they you to access my site?
- What is the profile of the users?


## Where are the users from?
Knowing where are the people who uses chooseyourplant from is so important to me as content creator in order to go as niche as possible and optimize my energy and time. In this case, knowing which are the hot spots or hot areas around the world will help me for many reasons:
  1. Modify the current content in order to optimize the SEO keywords for those regions.
  2. Create specific content for those areas (plants are kinda international, but not all the plants are found around the world because of shipping policies). Knowing this will optimize how you use your time because you're going not going to spend time researching and creating content that is not revelant for these areas.
  3. Reach shops in these areas in order to get presence, discounts and/or sponsorships. This shops are the ones relevant to my users because of proximity.


To know where are your users from go to your Google Analytics account > Audience > Geo > Location. You'll see a map which many colors which express the amount of people using your site around the world:

As you can see the people who comes to my site are from United States. This is useful in order to optimize our keywords and what words we use because they use different word than United Kingdom even though both speak English.

// image United States by state

Again, Knowing what states are the most common is good, but could we go more niche? Let's see.

Now that are now from which cities are people from, I can optimize how I spend my time because like I said:
1- I can target specific SEO keywords
2- I can create relevant content for these people
3- I can focus on shops that are near by these users
4- In case I wanted to pay ads, I can limit them to those cities so I would be optimizing money.

## What do the people use to access my site?
Understanding where my users are from is good but it's not enough, I must understand what they're using while they are in my site to:
1- Improve the web performance for those devices.
2- Focus on designing in those resolutions (if something is not perfect in a resolution that no one uses, I should fix it, but it's not the most important thing).
3- What browser do they use?
4- Improve the user experience in these devices.

To see all these metrics, you can access in your Google Analytics account by clicking the Audience tab > mobile Overview. I like to see some graphs in percentadge mode because it's easier for me to understand the metrics than in tables.

This show us most of the users of Chooseyourplant use mobile, so I should better focusing on mobile design rather than desktop. I should prioritize and spending more time on improving the performance on mobile so from now on:
1- I'll give more importance to the user interfaces and user experiences for mobile than desktop.
2- Web performance is important (in a mobile screen not all the content is visible at first, so I shouldn't load this content). This improves the UX and will save data to the user > loads faster > easier to crawl > better ranking.

On the other hand, knowing what browser the people use, will help us to prioritize bugs, improve the QA and over all, will give us speed on the development proccess. You can see what browser your users are using on the Audience tab > Technology > Browser & OS.

// image of % browser

We'd thought that because most of users use Apple, they're using Safari, but as we can see, the majority of the suers of Chooseyourplant are using Chrome, although Safari is the second most used. when developing our site, you must prioritize Chrome > Safari. As you can see, I shouldn't invest time on fixing bugs on Firefox If I want to optimize my time because it represents a 3.9% of my users only.


## What is the profile of the users

Knowing how old are your users, and if they're male of female, will help you to optimize your SEO keywords, content and to know about their interest as well, because a users that is 25 years old won't search with the same criteria or words than a 65 years old. Discover how old are your users by going to the Audience tab > Demographics > Age

# conclusions
After analyzing some metrics, I could profile better my users. In general, they majority of my users are 25-34 years old women from United States of America, in particular from Los Angeles, San Francisco, Portland and New York, that use chrome and Safari through on their phones. As commented at first, this help me to go niche because:
- I can create content that is relevant for those areas
- I can expose my content with keywords according to their register and how they search
- Add features that could interest them
- Find shops near by them
- Optimize my time of development to to mobile Chrome/Safari, the other can wait.
- In case of running ads, I can optimize the money so much.


# results
Since I profiled the people who use Chooseyourplant and I started to apply some of the actions, the organic growth and exposure in Google has growth significally as you can see:
